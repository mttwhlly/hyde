I wish I could offer you a ☕️ & a freshly-baked 🍩 to show you how happy I am that you're here but since the internet can't do that *(yet?)* here's a nifty GIF I found that I hope makes you smile 😃</p>

<div id="catgif"></div>

<p>I enjoyed that but if you didn't care for it, maybe <button class="button" onclick="catgif('#catgif')"> another one </button> will do the trick?</p>  


<p>Did I just see you smile? 🎉</p>     


<p>Okay, now seriously...since you've stayed with me this far (which I really appreciate 😊), would you happen to be...</p>
