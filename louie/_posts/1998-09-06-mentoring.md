¶ Having the opportunity to have a positive impact in the life of teenagers is my greatest joy. I currently mentor & give design lessons (Illustrator, Photoshop, Web design, screen-printing & other skills) at the [Broward County Main Library](http://www.broward.org/LIBRARY/LOCATIONSHOURS/BRANCHES/Pages/MN.aspx) Studio for teenagers between the ages of 14 and 19. I love getting to know the kids & helping them in any way I can. Every one is unique & has their own giftings. The more time I dedicate to helping the more I feel I am actually getting in return from them.

¶ More than any design I create, I hope to have a lasting impact in the lives of others through developing meaningful relationships with them.

¶ When I was 13, my family moved from the U.S. to Brazil to volunteer at New Horizons Youth Ranch - a program for children in need. I became a staff member & lived there for over 10 years. My time there changed the way I view the world & is still very dear to my heart.
