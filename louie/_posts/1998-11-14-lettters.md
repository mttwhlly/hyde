¶ One of the things that inspires me most are beautiful letters. Sometimes that means ornate scripts and sometimes it just means an unassuming font smartly used. I can get lost digging through junk shops & yard sales or staring at signs while walking around a city - its like finding buried treasure to me.

¶ I've open-sourced my collection of 700+ specimens for creatives to use for inspiration or for anyone really to just look at and hopefully feel a little amazed at the thought & creativity that has gone into design for so long - lots of times by people whose names we will never know.
