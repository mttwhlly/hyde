I wish I could offer you a cup of ☕️ & a freshly-baked 🍩 to show you how happy I am that you're here but since the internet can't do that *(yet?)* here's a nifty GIF I found instead that I hope makes you smile 😃     

<div id="catgif"></div>

I enjoyed that but if you didn't care for it, maybe <button class="button" onclick="catgif('#catgif')"> another one </button> will do the trick?     


I saw you smile - victory!! 🎉
