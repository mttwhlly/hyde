<span class="intro__p" markdown="1">I was asked to redesign the website for renowned American realist artist [John Whalley](http://johnwhalley.com) (who I have the honor of calling 'Dad'). Having previously built a site with the now unsupported iWeb, he needed a solution that would allow him to update on a regular basis & would be easily accessible to people interested in viewing from any device & (hopefully) buying his work. E-commerce functionality for purchasing prints, his books & potentially more products was a must. </span>

¶ We first considered the pages that would be needed & how they could look. I compiled a mood board on [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/mttwhlly) from my collection of web designs that may have elements we could derive inspiration from. I also had seen a few sites with eye-catching layouts to add to the discussion. 

¶ We decided to go with the direction of a grid-based responsive layout sketch we adjusted together until we were happy with it. 

¶ When the general visual direction was agreed upon, I went off to surf the webs to dig through the various open source Masonry grid Javascript-based frameworks available. I can adjust JS to my liking but am not experienced enough to write a grid framework from scratch.

¶ After investigating, I found 3 excellent options to be [Masonry.js](http://masonry.desandro.com/), [Isotope.js](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) & [Salvatorre](http://salvattore.com/). Each are very viable & well-documented solutions worth keeping in mind if you're looking to create a grid-based framework.

¶ Around the time of looking into grid frameworks, I came across a [Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/1629992-Semplice) by [Tobias Van Schneider](https://twitter.com/vanschneider) that caught my eye. After looking into it more, I found [Semplice](http://www.semplicelabs.com/) to be just what I needed for this site - thanks Tobias! - & quickly grabbed a license. I was able to get the site made relatively quickly & continue to perform maintenance on it as it becomes necessary for my dad.
