<span class="intro__p" markdown="1">I recently had the privilege of working with the Broward Arts Journalism Alliance to walk writers through the process of setting up & running a successful blog. My primary goal was to make them feel comfortable with pursuing blogging passionately by removing technical roadblocks through individual & group instruction & hands-on application of the procedures I outlined in the talk. This is the outline. </span>

### Overview / TL;DR   
1. Getting a good domain name
2. Choosing the right platform
3. Gathering quality content
4. Publishing
5. Sharing   

But first, a quick look at a mindset that can cripple you called the zero-sum mentality. Brad Weaver in his book Creative Truth argues

### 01. Getting the right domain name   

¶ This is very important & should be done thoughtfully.   

Best-selling business author Seth Godin has some great thoughts on naming on his [blog](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/10/the_new_rules_o.html).

Here are a few excerpts to think about:   

- "these rules have changed, largely because of the way people use Google...if you want Jet Blue or ikea or some other brand, you're just as likely to type the brand into google as you are to guess the domain name."

- "having the perfect domain name is nice, but it's WAY more important to have a name that works in technorati and yahoo and google when someone is seeking you out...sort of a built-in SEO strategy."

- "If I had a choice between a killer domain with a generic word in it or a great word that led to a less than perfect domain, I'd take the first, second every time."

<u>Instruction Set 01</u>

- Buy your domain name
    - Naming tools: [Wordoid](http://wordoid.com/), [Nameboy](http://www.nameboy.com/)    
    - DNS provider recommendation: [Namecheap](http://namecheap.com)   
- Follow the steps to point it at your website files
    - This process will vary depending on your choice of hosting & DNS provider.
- Set up your email address
    - [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) (formerly Google apps) can help make this tricky process easier for $5/month (worth it).
- Set up [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none)
    - We'll talk more about this later but for now just get your account set up & ready to use.

### 02. Choosing the right platform   

¶ Here's a list of some good content management systems to look into as WP is definitely not for everyone

#### CMS Platform List

##### Social Blogging Platforms
- [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) - a simple way to get started (with limited customization) on the most popular blogging platform

- [Wix](http://wix.com) - pretty popular option (I haven't seen a Wix site that has greatly impressed me yet (but if you find one, please let me know)
- [Weebly](http://weebly.com) - another seemingly pretty nice WYSIWG option I haven't tried personally
