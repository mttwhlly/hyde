<span class="intro__p" markdown="1">The Broward Cultural Division had a steadily declining email list of roughly 8,000 people. A rebranding effort was in the works & in an effort to increase community engagement through the #1 communication tool in our modern world, I designed & developed a responsive HTML email campaign.</span>

The Cultural Division had been using Patronmail so after investigating email service providers I recommended a switch to MailChimp.

Using MailChimp's HTML templating language, I created reusable templates that could be styled differently with each new campaign without having to edit the HTML source code. Colors, images & other media, buttons & font sizes were pre-defined but could be customized by the editor.
